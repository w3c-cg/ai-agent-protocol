      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>This paper explores the evolution from the unfulfilled vision of the Semantic Web to the emerging Agentic Web, and analyzes the necessity of establishing standardized agent network protocols. Despite the forward-thinking concept of the Semantic Web proposed twenty years ago, it was not fully realized due to the limitations of artificial intelligence capabilities at that time. With the rapid development of modern AI technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs), agents now possess the ability to autonomously execute tasks, perform complex reasoning, and solve multi-step problems, thus giving rise to the Agentic Web. Through systematic analysis, this paper identifies four core trends of the agent network: agents replacing traditional software as internet infrastructure, universal interconnection between agents, protocol-based native connection patterns, and agents' autonomous organization and collaboration capabilities. Meanwhile, the research reveals three major challenges that the current internet architecture poses to the development of the Agentic Web: data silos limiting the quality of agent decision-making, human-machine interfaces hindering agent interaction efficiency, and the absence of standard protocols impeding agent collaboration. In response to these challenges, this paper elaborates on the design principles and core requirements for agent network protocols, and provides a systematic comparison and analysis of current major agent network protocol initiatives (MCP, A2A, ACP, ANP, etc.). The conclusion emphasizes that establishing standardized agent network protocols is crucial for breaking down data silos, enabling heterogeneous agent collaboration, building AI-native data networks, and ultimately realizing an open and efficient Agentic Web, while calling on all stakeholders to actively participate in W3C's standardization process.</p>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>1. Introduction: From the Unfulfilled Vision of the Semantic Web to the Dawn of the Agentic Web</h2>
      
      <p>Twenty years ago, Tim Berners-Lee and his collaborators visionary proposed the concept of the Semantic Web, with the core objective of creating a data-centric, machine-readable web of data, enabling computers and humans to collaborate more efficiently. This concept depicted an intelligent future: daily transactions, administrative affairs, and various life scenarios would be automatically completed by "intelligent agents" through machine-to-machine dialogues. To achieve this goal, the Semantic Web planned to give clear semantic definitions to information on the web through technologies such as XML, RDF, and Ontology, enabling software agents to autonomously navigate between web pages and efficiently execute complex tasks on behalf of users.</p>   
      
      <p>Although the vision of the Semantic Web was highly forward-thinking and had a profound impact, it was largely unrealized, primarily due to the limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities at that time. Early AI technologies had obvious deficiencies in understanding natural language, executing complex reasoning, and processing massive, ambiguous, inconsistent, or uncertain data in the real world. Moreover, the complexity of automatic knowledge representation, acquisition, and large-scale reasoning became insurmountable obstacles. However, the latest technological revolution represented by Large Language Models (LLMs) is injecting new powerful momentum into realizing this grand vision. Modern AI has made significant breakthroughs in understanding unstructured data, multi-step reasoning, planning, and interacting with tools and APIs, which precisely compensate for the key shortcomings of early AI in achieving the goals of the Semantic Web.</p>   
      
      <p>Notably, the original concept of the Semantic Web already included rich "agent" ideas. These agents were envisioned as entities that could automatically execute tasks on behalf of users. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology, especially the technological breakthroughs represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous agents have emerged that can act autonomously, perform complex reasoning, and solve multi-step problems. These agents are no longer just passive tools, but have become active participants in the digital ecosystem. Against this background, the concept of the "Agentic Web" or "Internet of Agents" has emerged. This new network paradigm views agents as primary actors, actively interacting with network resources, services, and other agents to collectively accomplish user goals. The Agentic Web inherits the core vision of the Semantic Web and, leveraging advanced AI capabilities, is committed to building an ecosystem composed of autonomous, intelligent, and efficiently collaborative agents, gradually making the Semantic Web's ideal of machine intelligence efficiently processing information and effectively assisting humans a reality.</p>   
      
      <p>This transformation heralds a fundamental change in user interaction patterns—from human-centered clicking and browsing through browsers to agent-centered interactions and collaborations driven by agents. In this new model, agents will autonomously interact directly with other agents, automatically complete tasks, and provide personalized experiences based on user preferences and context. This agent-dominated model is not just an incremental update to the existing network, but may trigger profound changes in internet architecture and interaction logic. The way users access information will also change, from actively querying information through interfaces to agents actively executing tasks and delivering results, possibly bypassing traditional website interfaces. This will promote a comprehensive innovation in the design methods, discovery mechanisms, and interaction modes of network services, pushing the internet into a new stage of development.</p>

    </section>
    <section id="trends">
      <h2>2. Four Major Trends of the Agentic Web</h2>
      
      <p>Just as the vision of the Semantic Web once opened up new possibilities for internet development, today, the Agent-centric Agentic Web is leading the internet toward a new era full of opportunities and transformations. This shift not only signifies technological advancement but also represents a profound revolution in the underlying architecture of the internet and user interaction logic. This agent-driven paradigm shift is primarily manifested in the following four key trends.</p>
      
      <section>
        <h3>2.1 Agents Will Drive the Comprehensive Upgrade of Traditional Software</h3>
        
        <p>With the continuous evolution of agent technology, we are standing at a turning point for the upgrade of traditional software systems. Agents will not only become important infrastructure for the next generation of the internet but are also expected to reshape how people interact with the digital world. At the individual level, traditional websites and apps will gradually evolve into personal agents, becoming the main entry points for users to access the internet. Compared to interface-based applications that rely on manual operations, agents demonstrate significant advantages in information integration, intent recognition, decision support, and multimodal scenario interaction, potentially bringing users order-of-magnitude improvements in user experience. At the enterprise level, companies will deploy enterprise agents to connect directly with personal agents, providing more precise, efficient, and continuous service experiences without relying on intermediary platforms. Meanwhile, a new connection paradigm characterized by point-to-point, disintermediated connections between personal agents and enterprise agents is rapidly forming, indicating a more flexible, intelligent, and decentralized internet architecture is on the horizon.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>2.2 Universal Interconnection Between Agents</h3>

        <p>In the landscape of the Agentic Web, agents are no longer isolated operating units but form a highly interconnected, collaboratively evolving network system. Enabling free connections between any agents will fundamentally break the structural limitations of "platform fragmentation" and "data silos" in the current internet, allowing information to flow freely between different domains and systems. This interconnection not only means data interoperability but also represents agents' ability to dynamically acquire and combine cross-platform, cross-scenario contextual information, thereby demonstrating stronger comprehensive perception and reasoning capabilities when serving individual users or organizational decision-making. At the same time, open connection mechanisms enable agents to call upon network-wide tools and capability resources as needed, building more complex and deeper collaboration chains. Driven by this trend, interactions between agents will gradually replace human-centered interaction methods, becoming the most core and dynamic form of connection in the future internet.</p>

      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>2.3 Protocol-Based Native Connection Patterns for Agents</h3>
        
        <p>Currently, AI's interaction with the internet primarily relies on human-centered interface methods, such as Computer Use and Browser Use. While these interaction paths provide AI with preliminary access capabilities, they are essentially designed for human users and struggle to fully leverage AI's capabilities in information parsing, semantic processing, and automated execution. In fact, AI excels at handling structured data, semantically annotated information, and explicit function calls, rather than complex and variable webpage HTML or frontend interfaces. Therefore, the future Agentic Web urgently needs to build a network protocol system natively designed for AI, allowing agents to interact directly in a machine-readable, semantically clear manner. Such protocols will play a role similar to HTTP in the human internet, becoming the foundational communication standard supporting the agent network. Based on this protocol system, an entirely new data network specifically designed for AI, more accessible and operable by agents, will also emerge.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h3>2.4 Agents Can Self-Organize and Collaborate</h3>
        
        <p>Another key trend in the evolution of the Agentic Web is that agents will possess stronger capabilities for autonomous organization and collaboration. With the support of unified communication protocols, agents can dynamically negotiate through natural language, quickly identify each other's capabilities, intentions, and needs, and autonomously form collaborative relationships and complete task divisions without preset interfaces. This flexible, highly adaptive interaction mode breaks through the limitations of traditional systems that rely on static interfaces and manual orchestration, significantly improving network operational efficiency and task response speed while greatly reducing human intervention and integration costs. As collaborative mechanisms continue to evolve, an agent network ecosystem that is self-driven, highly composable, and capable of rapid response will gradually form, providing a solid foundation for complex task processing and multi-agent system operations.</p>
      </section>
      
      <p>In summary, the rise of the Agentic Web not only means that agents will play a greater role in various applications but also indicates a profound reshaping of internet infrastructure and interaction paradigms. To achieve this evolutionary direction, there is an urgent need to build a new protocol system for agent networks, thereby providing the necessary infrastructure and standard support for agents to fully unleash their capabilities.</p>

    <section id="challenges">
      <h2>3. Challenges of the Agentic Web: Limitations of the Current Internet and the Urgent Need for Standardized Interaction</h2>
      
      <p>With the development of AI technology, agents are gradually becoming the new generation of core participants in the internet ecosystem, following websites and applications. However, the accelerated evolution of the Agentic Web also exposes many limitations in the technical foundation and connection paradigms of the current internet. If these issues are not addressed, they will severely constrain the scalability and collaborative efficiency of agent systems. The main challenges include the following three aspects:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Silos Limiting Agent Decision Quality</strong>: Agents need to integrate extensive information to make high-quality decisions. However, data on the current internet is scattered across disconnected platforms, forming "data silos." This prevents agents from obtaining complete contextual information, severely constraining their analytical, reasoning, and decision-making capabilities.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Human-Machine Interfaces Hindering Agent Interaction Efficiency</strong>: Most existing network services are designed for humans through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Agents need to simulate human operations to use these services, making the process complex, inefficient, and error-prone. There is an urgent need to provide native, machine-readable interface protocols for agents to enable direct and efficient automated interactions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Lack of Standard Protocols Impeding Agent Collaboration</strong>: Agents lack unified communication languages and collaboration norms. While natural language provides a means of communication, it is insufficient to support large-scale, reliable, automated agent collaboration. Establishing standardized protocols is key to networking agents and leveraging collective intelligence.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>These challenges, especially the lack of standardized agent network protocols, will lead to fragmentation of the agent ecosystem in the future. Numerous heterogeneous agents will become "agent islands," making it difficult to interoperate and collaborate effectively, not only limiting the overall potential of the Agentic Web but also significantly increasing integration costs and complexity (18).</p>
      
      <p>Faced with this situation, establishing standardized agent network protocols has become an urgent priority for building a truly Agentic Web. Such protocols aim to provide a unified framework for discovery, identification, communication, and collaboration among agents from different platforms and vendors, thereby overcoming interoperability barriers and ensuring secure and efficient interactions. The establishment of the W3C AI Agent Protocol Community Group and its mission is an active response to this need. Standardization is not only a technical requirement but also a strategic cornerstone to prevent the Agentic Web from becoming balkanized and to fully leverage its network effects and realize the vision of "billions of agents" working collaboratively.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="blueprint">

  <h2>4. Defining the Blueprint: Key Issues and Core Requirements for Agent Network Protocols</h2>
  
  <p>To address the challenges presented in Chapter 3 and fully leverage the potential of the Agentic Web, designing and implementing standardized agent network protocols is crucial. These protocols are not just technical specifications but cornerstones for building an interoperable, trustworthy, and efficient agent ecosystem. A comprehensive agent network protocol framework needs to address a series of key issues and meet specific functional and non-functional requirements.</p>
  
  <section>
    <h3>4.1 Key Issues That Agent Network Protocols Aim to Solve</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interconnection and Breaking Down Data Silos</strong>: Protocols need to provide mechanisms for agents created by different platforms and developers to discover, connect, and communicate with each other, thereby breaking down the data silos prevalent in the current internet. This requires protocols to support cross-domain communication and promote the free flow of information, ensuring that agents can access complete contextual information needed for high-quality decision-making.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Collaboration Between Heterogeneous Agents</strong>: The Agentic Web will consist of a large number of heterogeneous agents with different architectures, capabilities, and goals. Protocols must be able to address communication and collaboration issues between these heterogeneous agents, for example, through standardized message formats, interaction patterns, and capability description mechanisms, enabling them to understand each other and work together.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Compatibility and Standard Reuse</strong>: To promote widespread adoption and integration, agent network protocols should be compatible with and reuse existing mature Web standards and technologies (such as HTTP, WebRTC, OpenAPI, WoT, etc.) whenever possible. This not only reduces development and deployment barriers but also helps fully leverage the stability and security of existing network infrastructure.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Efficient Collaboration and Privacy-Preserving Interaction Models</strong>: Protocols need to define information interaction patterns between agents that ensure both collaboration efficiency and user privacy and data security. This may involve encrypting communication content, supporting selective information sharing, and defining access control mechanisms of different granularities.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Building Trust and Reducing Collaboration Costs</strong>: In the open Agentic Web, trust between agents is a core issue. Protocols should include mechanisms for establishing and verifying agent identity, reputation, and capabilities to reduce the risks and costs of collaboration between unknown agents and promote trustworthy interactions.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>4.2 Core Functional Requirements for Agent Network Protocols</h3>
    
    <p>A comprehensive agent network protocol should meet the following core functional requirements to support the effective operation of agents in the Agentic Web:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Agent Identity</strong>: Build unified identity representation and verification mechanisms that enable agents to make trusted identity claims and authentication across different platforms, services, and domains, thereby achieving interoperability and trust transfer in cross-platform environments.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Agent Description</strong>: Establish standardized agent description models for expressing agent information, functions, interfaces, and service scope, allowing other agents to accurately understand their capability boundaries based on unified semantics, and enabling automatic parsing and invocation.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Agent Discovery</strong>: Support agents in dynamically searching for and locating other suitable agents in the network based on semantic matching, task requirements, or capability characteristics, thereby building a distributed agent network for on-demand collaboration.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Agent Data Exchange</strong>: Formulate unified data formats and interaction processes for reliable transmission of information, instructions, and context between agents, ensuring semantic consistency, structural standardization, and collaborative effectiveness in cross-agent communication.</li>

      <li><strong>Agent Capability Invocation</strong>: Based on identity, description, and discovery mechanisms, establish a universal invocation mechanism that supports one agent calling the services or interfaces exposed by another agent, enabling task delegation, process orchestration, and cross-agent collaborative operations. The invocation process needs to cover a complete loop including interface discovery, parameter passing, permission verification, and execution feedback, ensuring the accuracy, security, and auditability of the invocation.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>4.3 Key Non-Functional Requirements for Agent Network Protocols</h3>
    
    <p>In addition to core functionalities, agent network protocols must also meet a series of key non-functional requirements to ensure their usability, reliability, and trustworthiness in real-world applications:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security</strong>: Provide comprehensive mechanisms for identity authentication, access control, data integrity verification, and communication encryption, with capabilities to protect against common attacks (such as forgery, tampering, replay, etc.), ensuring secure and trustworthy interactions between agents.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Protocol design should embed privacy protection mechanisms, avoid unnecessary data exposure and sharing, support minimizing the transmission of personal information during agent interactions, and comply with relevant legal requirements and regulations.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Protocol design should possess good scaling capabilities to handle increasing numbers of agents and interactions without significant performance degradation.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: Protocol design should have good evolutionary capabilities, able to flexibly adapt to future AI capability evolution, emergence of new agent roles, and constantly changing interaction patterns.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Ensure compatibility with existing Web protocols and standards where appropriate, and enable agents from different developers/platforms to work together collaboratively (11).</li>
      
      <li><strong>Auditability</strong>: Support comprehensive recording, tracing, and review of agent behaviors and interaction processes, ensuring verification, analysis, and accountability determination in case of disputes or abnormal behaviors.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  
  <p>By addressing the key issues above and meeting these core requirements, standardized agent network protocols will lay a solid foundation for building a prosperous, collaborative, and trustworthy Agentic Web.</p>

  <h2>5. Overview of Current Agent Network Protocol Initiatives</h2>
  
  <p>This section aims to provide a neutral overview of some current and emerging agent network protocols, highlighting how they address the challenges and requirements discussed earlier. These protocols each target different aspects of interoperability and deployment scenarios, collectively forming the exploratory frontier of current agent communication standardization.</p>

  <section>
    <h3>5.1 Model Context Protocol (MCP)</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Description</strong>: MCP is an open standard initiated by Anthropic and now open-sourced, aimed at standardizing how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs). It is metaphorically described as the "USB-C port for AI applications," targeting the M×N integration challenge faced when AI models connect with external data sources, tools, and systems (such as cloud platforms, enterprise databases, local files). By providing a unified interface, MCP simplifies interactions between AI models and the external world, reducing the need to build custom connectors for each new data source or tool.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Key Features/Mechanisms</strong>: MCP adopts a client-server architecture where AI applications (such as chat assistants, AI-driven IDEs) act as MCP clients, connecting to one or more MCP servers that expose capabilities or data (31). Its core interaction primitives include: Tools (executable functions that can be dynamically invoked, such as API calls), Resources (structured static data streams for AI reference), and Prompts (reusable conversation workflows or templates). The protocol layer handles message framing, request/response mapping, and notification delivery, supporting various transport protocols such as Stdio for local processes and HTTP+SSE for network services.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Focus Areas/Target Challenges</strong>: MCP's core goals are to provide structured context injection for LLMs, enable flexible plugging of tools and knowledge, support secure infrastructure integration, and ensure compatibility across different LLM vendors. It aims to enhance AI models' context awareness and dynamic tool discovery and execution capabilities.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Core Technologies Used</strong>: JSON-RPC (for client-server interface), HTTP, Server-Sent Events (SSE).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>5.2 Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) (Google)</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Description</strong>: A2A is an open protocol initiated by Google and jointly promoted with over 50 industry partners, designed to enable independent AI agents built on different frameworks by different vendors to communicate, collaborate, and coordinate actions securely and seamlessly. It aims to address interoperability issues in heterogeneous agent ecosystems, allowing agents to work together without exposing their internal states, memories, or tools.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Key Features/Mechanisms</strong>: A2A's core architecture revolves around client agents and remote agents. Agents publish their identities, capabilities, skills, service endpoints, and authentication requirements through "Agent Cards" (JSON metadata documents), enabling capability discovery. The protocol supports task management lifecycle, allowing creation, sending, and tracking of task status, and can handle long-running tasks that might take hours or even days. A2A supports multiple interaction modalities, including text, files, structured JSON data, as well as audio and video streams.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Focus Areas/Target Challenges</strong>: A2A focuses on enabling dynamic interaction, capability sharing, and task coordination between opaque, autonomous agents, especially in enterprise-grade workflows. It aims to break down agent silos, simplify enterprise integration, and foster a more interconnected, powerful AI ecosystem. A2A addresses different problems than MCP, with MCP focusing on connecting agents with tools/data, while A2A focuses on collaboration between agents.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Core Technologies Used</strong>: HTTP(S) (as the transport layer, requiring TLS encryption), JSON-RPC 2.0 (as the payload format for requests and responses), Server-Sent Events (SSE) (for real-time streaming communication from server to client, such as task status updates).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>5.3 Agent Connect Protocol (ACP) (Cisco)</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Description</strong>: ACP is an open-source protocol led by Cisco and developed in collaboration with partners such as LangChain and Galileo as part of the AGNTCY initiative, designed to provide a communication layer for autonomous agents to collaborate and share resources in distributed systems.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Key Features/Mechanisms</strong>: ACP adopts RESTful APIs as the standard interface, defining how agents interact, including retrieving workflows that agents can execute, creating and managing context threads, and running agents. It supports stateful communication threads, allowing agents to negotiate and reason together during tasks, and implements loosely coupled interactions through message passing. Agent discovery is achieved through the Agent Directory and OASF (Open Agentic Schema Framework) documents, which are standardized JSON files describing agent capabilities, invocation methods, input/output patterns, and more. ACP supports asynchronous-first interactions, multi-part messages, and observability features.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Focus Areas/Target Challenges</strong>: ACP primarily addresses communication barriers and collaboration efficiency issues between heterogeneous agents (potentially built on different technology stacks or frameworks) in enterprise environments. It aims to enable scalable, standardized multi-agent interactions, allowing multiple agents to work together as a logical unit to complete complex tasks.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Core Technologies Used</strong>: RESTful APIs, JSON (for OASF documents and message schemas). Can be integrated with workflow frameworks such as LangGraph.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>5.4 Agent Network Protocol (ANP)</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Description</strong>: ANP is an open-source protocol with the vision of becoming "the HTTP of the Agentic Web era," designed to build an open, secure, and efficient collaborative network for billions of agents. It aims to address the inadequacies of current internet infrastructure in meeting the specific needs of agent networks. ANP is developed and maintained by the open-source community, which is committed to an open, neutral stance, and the community pledges never to commercialize.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Key Features/Mechanisms</strong>: ANP primarily addresses the connection and collaboration of agents on the internet, adopting a three-layer architecture:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Identity and Encrypted Communication Layer</strong>: Builds decentralized authentication schemes and end-to-end encrypted communication based on W3C DID (Decentralized Identifier) specifications, enabling cross-platform agents to authenticate each other without relying on centralized systems.</li>
          <li><strong>Meta-Protocol Layer</strong>: A protocol for negotiating communication protocols between agents, key to enabling self-organization and self-negotiation for efficient collaboration in agent networks.</li>
          <li><strong>Application Protocol Layer</strong>: Based on Semantic Web specifications, using JSON-LD and schema.org to describe agent information, capabilities, and interfaces. The entry point for an agent is an Agent Description Document. Uses RFC 8615 to design agent discovery mechanisms, W3C VC to implement credential records for transactions between agents, while reusing many existing specifications such as OpenAPI, WebRTC, etc.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      
      <li><strong>Focus Areas/Target Challenges</strong>: ANP aims to address three core challenges of the agent internet: achieving interconnection between all agents, breaking data silos, and ensuring AI can access complete contextual information; providing AI-native interfaces for efficient interaction with the digital world through APIs or communication protocols rather than mimicking human operations; and utilizing AI for automatic organization and negotiation between agents to build a more economically efficient collaborative network. It particularly focuses on decentralized discovery and collaboration in open internet environments, as well as interoperability across heterogeneous domains.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Core Technologies Used</strong>: W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), JSON-LD, W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC), end-to-end encryption technologies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Building AI-Native Data Networks Based on Agent Network Protocol</h2>
    <p>Current internet infrastructure is primarily designed for human interaction through browsers and graphical user interfaces. However, the rise of the Agentic Web requires us to reimagine a network environment more suitable for AI agents' native interactions. This "AI-native data network" will no longer be merely a platform for displaying human information, but an optimized space for agents to efficiently acquire data, invoke services, and collaborate.</p>
    
    <p>The core characteristics of such a network will include:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Machine-readable interfaces first</strong>: Services and data sources will expose their functionality and information through standardized, agent-friendly APIs (rather than primarily relying on human user interfaces). This will greatly reduce the complexity and overhead for agents to access and utilize network resources.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Enhanced semantic and structured data</strong>: Data will not only be accessible but also understandable. Drawing on semantic web concepts and combined with modern AI's understanding capabilities, data will be given richer semantic descriptions and structured representations, enabling agents to reason and make decisions more precisely.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Communication protocols optimized for AI</strong>: Beyond general agent network protocols, underlying network communications may also need to be optimized for agent interaction characteristics, such as supporting low-latency, high-throughput multimodal data exchange, and more flexible communication patterns.</li>
      
      <li><strong>Dynamic service discovery and composition</strong>: Agents will be able to dynamically discover needed services and data in this network, and flexibly combine them according to task requirements, achieving complex collaborative task solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>AI-native data networks will be key infrastructure for the Agentic Web to fully realize its potential, enabling agents to interact with the digital world in their most proficient way (i.e., directly processing information through protocols and APIs), thereby catalyzing higher levels of automation, intelligence, and collaborative efficiency.</p>

    <h2>7. Future Outlook: Reshaping the Open Network Through Connection</h2>
    
    <p>The evolution of the internet profoundly confirms a core principle: "Connection is Power." In a truly open, interconnected network, free interaction between nodes can maximize innovation potential and create enormous value. However, today's internet ecosystem is increasingly dominated by a few large platforms, with vast amounts of data and services confined within closed "digital islands," concentrating the power of connection in the hands of a few tech giants.</p>
    
    <p>The advent of the Agentic Web era provides us with a historic opportunity to reshape this imbalanced landscape. Our goal is to drive the internet from its current generally closed, fragmented state back to its open, freely connected origins. In the future Agentic Web, each agent will simultaneously play the dual roles of information consumer and service provider. More importantly, every node should be able to discover, connect, and interact with any other node in the network without barriers. This vision of universal interconnection will greatly reduce the barriers to information flow and collaboration, returning the power of connection truly to each user and individual agent.</p>
    
    <p>This marks an important shift: from platform-centric closed ecosystems to protocol-centric open ecosystems. In the latter, value acquisition depends more on the unique capabilities and contributions that participants bring to the network by following open protocols, rather than relying on control over a closed platform. This shift will stimulate more intense application-layer innovation and competition, as the key to success is no longer "locking in" users, but providing superior agent services, similar to the innovation patterns historically promoted by open protocols like TCP/IP and SMTP.</p>

    <h2>8. Building the Future of a Collaborative Agentic Web</h2>
    
    <p>Standardized agent network protocols are crucial for unleashing the potential of the Agentic Web, realizing certain aspects of the original semantic web vision, and fostering innovation. They are the cornerstone for building a network where machines can process information more intelligently and assist humans more effectively.</p>
    
    <p>We urge all stakeholders to actively participate in the standardization process through the W3C. This is an opportunity to shape the future network—one that is more intelligent, collaborative, and empowering, built on foundations of openness and trust. A well-designed Agentic Web has tremendous transformative potential, and now is the critical moment to lay its solid foundation.</p>
