# Meeting Assets for AI Agent Protocol CG Meeting

**Date**: 2026-01-28

## Quick Recap

The W3C AI Agent Protocol Community Group meeting on January 28, 2026 (21:02-22:04 UTC) brought together key stakeholders to discuss the necessity of standardization in the age of successful standalone AI products and to review technical proposals for DID-OAuth compatibility. The discussion highlighted the tension between proprietary innovation and interoperability standards, while Sean Zhang presented a comprehensive approach to integrating decentralized identity with existing OAuth frameworks.

## Agenda

1. Industry Observation: The success of standalone products (Claude/Anthropic MCP) vs. the necessity of standardization
2. Technical Proposal: Research on the compatibility between DID (Decentralized Identifiers) and OAuth protocols

## Participants

- **Song** (Chair)
- **George Fletcher**
- **Jeff Whelpley**
- **Chris Phillips**
- **Sean Zhang** (Presenter)
- **Geun-Hyung Kim**

## Discussion Topics

### I. Standardization vs. Standalone Product Success

**Core Question**: If a product like Claude can succeed without broad standardization, is the work of this Community Group (CG) on agent-to-agent communication protocols necessary?

**Key Perspectives**:

- **Song's Perspective**: Standardization is focused on the "Internet of Agents," which requires interoperability between multiple agents, whereas a standalone product's success focuses on a localized environment.

- **George Fletcher's Input**: 
  - Standardization often follows product innovation; developers first build what meets their immediate needs (e.g., Anthropic's MCP)
  - The need for standards arises when integration costs become too high due to a "NASCAR effect" of too many incompatible proprietary APIs

- **Jeff Whelpley's Addition**: Claude emphasizes a personalized environment controlled by the individual, which differs from the CG's goal of enabling bots that do not know each other to collaborate.

- **Chris Phillips' Analogy**: He compared the current landscape to the development of SCIM, noting that major vendors (Google, Anthropic) are currently incentivized to grow their own ecosystems rather than cross-pollinate.

### II. Technical Presentation: DID and OAuth Compatibility

Sean Zhang presented a research document exploring how to integrate DID into existing OAuth/OIDC frameworks to allow Agents to access legacy protected resources.

#### 1. Core Architecture Proposal

**Agent to Agent (A2A)**: Direct authentication using DID signatures and SDKs is straightforward for new technologies.

**Agent to Resource**: Proposed a "DID Authentication IDP" (Identity Provider).

**Workflow**:
- An agent authenticates via DID to the DID IDP
- The IDP issues a standard OIDC ID Token
- The agent exchanges this ID Token for an Access Token from an OAuth Authorization Server (AS) to access resources

#### 2. Key Technical Features

- **DPoP Integration**: Using the agent's DID public key to fulfill the role of DPoP (Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession), binding the token to the client key to prevent replay attacks

- **Zero Trust Scenarios**: Support for merging multiple Verifiable Credentials (VCs) into a single Verifiable Presentation (VP) to enhance security

- **Compatibility**: The proposal utilizes the Authorization Code Flow, allowing agents to simulate browser-based flows to work with existing ID servers

### III. Feedback and Expert Review

- **George Fletcher**: Commended the work but emphasized the need to figure out "sender-constraining" mechanisms and clarify where the authorization policy actually runs (the agent or the supporting server)

- **Chris Phillips**: Highlighted the "Cross-domain" gap; while OAuth often assumes a single domain, using DIDs requires establishing trust roots across different ecosystems

- **Geun-Hyung Kim**: Asked if this document would become part of the AMP (Agent Network Protocol) specification

- **Song's Clarification**: 
  - The presentation is for open discussion within the W3C CG for standardization
  - The actual implementation is being handled in the AMP Community, which is a separate open-source effort

## Next Steps

- **Document Publication**: The comparative research on authentication methods will be made public within the community soon
- **Ongoing Collaboration**: Discussions will continue via Slack and GitHub, specifically focusing on refining the DID IDP definition and cross-domain trust
