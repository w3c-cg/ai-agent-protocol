# Meeting Assets for AI Agent Protocol CG Meeting

**Date**: 2026-01-14

## Quick Recap

The meeting began with Song providing an overview of the W3C Community Group on AI Agent Protocols and addressing questions about its role and capabilities. The group then discussed agent identity authentication schemes and cross-vendor authentication methods, with a focus on DID-based identity mechanisms and OAuth for agent-to-agent authorization. The conversation ended with plans to create a roadmap for the group's activities and address outstanding questions about trust levels and revocation mechanisms in future discussions.

## Next Steps

- **Seanzhang**: Research and provide a response regarding the mechanism for determining trust levels between agents, including how trust is established and managed, and address Jeff's question (to be shared in GitHub or future communication)
- **Seanzhang**: Add explanation/section to the document about how the proposed token mechanism can be compatible with new standards (e.g., Depop, OAuth enhancements) and ensure support for token binding to private keys as suggested by George
- **Seanzhang**: Share the updated document link in Slack and/or via email list as requested by Paola
- **Song**: Discuss with Gaowei (co-chair) and other relevant W3C contacts to clarify and communicate the current and planned comparison/roadmap of different technologies (e.g., OAuth, DID, A2A) being discussed in the group, and consider developing a checklist or guidance for layperson evaluation of these technologies
- **Song**: Work with Gaowei to develop and share a tentative roadmap for the group to help new members understand the group's plans and value
- **Song**: Ensure meeting minutes and relevant updates are posted to both the email list and Slack after the meeting

## Summary

### W3C AI Agent Protocols Overview

Song, co-chair of the W3C Community Group (CG) on AI Agent Protocols, provided an overview of the group's role and recent activities. Song clarified that while CGs cannot create official W3C specifications, they can publish community group reports and contribute to the development of specifications through working groups. Geun-Hyung raised questions about the group's ability to make recommendations, which Roy addressed by explaining the distinction between CG reports and W3C specifications. Song mentioned that while there is no immediate plan to create an AI agent protocol, it remains a long-term goal for the group, with ongoing discussions about its feasibility and value within W3C.

### AI Authentication and Language Support

The meeting began with Roy raising concerns about an AI agent participant, which Song addressed by suggesting removing non-human attendees. Song encouraged participants to speak in their native language if English was challenging, as the call had English transcriber functionality. The main agenda focused on discussing agent identity authentication schemes and cross-vendor authentication methods, with the meeting scheduled for 60 minutes.

### DID-Based Agent Authentication Protocol

The team discussed the use of DID-based identity mechanisms for agent networks, highlighting their advantages over traditional approaches like PKI. Sean presented a protocol for agent authentication using DIDs, which allows for direct verification without third-party platforms and supports federated architecture. George raised concerns about the trust framework and suggested exploring OAuth as an alternative to pre-registration, while also questioning the feasibility of using HTTP message signatures or a one-time call to the token endpoint. The discussion emphasized the need for further exploration of trust frameworks and semantic equivalency across different technologies.

### Authorization Mechanisms Discussion Overview

The meeting focused on discussing authorization mechanisms, particularly the use of DID (Decentralized Identifiers) and OAuth for agent-to-agent authorization. Sean explained their approach of keeping DID simple with a focus on domain path and public key, while using tokens as a medium for trust transfer. George raised concerns about maintaining OAuth capabilities in the token request/response process. The group discussed the need for a clear comparison of different authorization technologies and agreed to create a roadmap for the group's activities. The conversation ended with a plan to share the document link in Slack and email, and to address outstanding questions about trust levels and revocation mechanisms in future discussions.
