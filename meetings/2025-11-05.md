## Meeting Summary

### Quick Summary

The meeting primarily focused on Chris's presentation about OpenID Connect Federation and Model Context Protocol (MCP), discussing trust management in AI language models and demonstrating practical examples using GitHub sign-on. The team explored the integration of client attestation with entity statements to establish trust mechanisms in workload connections, and discussed improving trust verification processes through collaboration between the DCP Working Group and the OpenID Foundation. The meeting also covered the implementation of OpenID Federation in Agent-to-Agent interactions, as well as upcoming presentations at the IETF meeting in Montreal and the TPAC meeting in Kobe, Japan.

### Next Steps

- **Song, Gaowei, Roy**: Attend and present at the W3C TPAC face-to-face meeting in Kobe, Japan on Tuesday and Wednesday next week
- **Song, Gaowei, Roy**: Provide a summary and full overview of the TPAC meeting in the next weekly call
- **Song**: Provide a summary of the IETF Montreal side meeting organized by China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom
- **Roy**: Share the Zoom link for the community group on-site meeting at TPAC to facilitate remote participation
- **George**: Check the W3C calendar to confirm the community group meeting time and determine if he can join remotely

## Detailed Meeting Content

### 1. IIW Presentation: OpenID Connect Federation

Chris introduced his attendance at IIW (Internet Identity Workshop) and his upcoming presentation on OpenID Connect Federation and Model Context Protocol. Song indicated he would provide an introduction from the W3C and AMPA open source community perspectives after Chris's presentation. The meeting also briefly discussed the availability of translation services.

### 2. Trust Mechanisms in AI Identity Management

Chris delivered a presentation on OpenID Connect and Model Context Protocol (MCP), emphasizing the importance of trust in AI and identity management. He discussed the challenges and opportunities in using MCP to connect AI language models, highlighting the need to use OAuth and OpenID Connect to establish trust and access control.

**Key content included**:

- A practical demonstration using GitHub sign-on and a trust gateway
- Showing how to add trust marks to tokens to enhance security
- Encouraging critical thinking about trust in AI connections

### 3. Trust Verification in Workload Connections

George and Chris discussed how to integrate client attestation with entity statements to establish trust in non-predetermined connections between workloads.

**Key discussion points**:

- MCP currently uses bearer tokens for authentication
- There is currently a lack of established methods for evaluating trust through entity statements
- Opportunities exist to improve trust verification processes through collaboration between the DCP Working Group and the OpenID Foundation
- Chris mentioned ongoing development of a Node.js library to facilitate trust management
- Explored the possibility of implementing trust verification in A2A (Agent-to-Agent) agent cards

### 4. OpenID Federation Trust Integration Discussion

The meeting focused on discussing the integration of OpenID Federation with MCP, with Song providing feedback on Chris's presentation.

**Main topics**:

- How OpenID Federation can address trust issues and enable portable trust across domains
- Gaowei raised questions about using OpenID Federation for trust verification in Agent-to-Agent interactions
- George suggested combining entity statements with client attestation to establish stronger trust between workloads
- The team discussed the necessity of separating discovery from trust in Agent-to-Agent interactions

### 5. IETF and TPAC Meeting Arrangements

Song mentioned upcoming presentations at the IETF meeting in Montreal and the face-to-face meeting in Kobe, Japan. Roy indicated he would provide remote participation options to ensure members unable to attend in person can still participate in the discussions.
