# Meeting Summary for AI Agent Protocol CG Meeting (08/27/2025)

## Meeting Summary

The meeting began with a demonstration of Zoom's real-time translation capabilities for multilingual communication, where participants tested speaking in different languages while displaying translations to all participants. The group then discussed the agenda for the upcoming CG meeting and breakout session at TPAC 2025 in November, including logistics for both in-person and online attendance. The conversation ended with presentations on web navigation improvements and a new protocol called Aura, followed by discussions about identity management solutions and authentication methods, with participants expressing interest in contributing to the W3C's agent protocol community group.

## Next Steps

- **Bedo/Dervis** to add their Aura project to the AI Agent Protocol CG white paper in GitHub
- **Bedo/Dervis** to join the AI Agent Protocol Community Group and contribute to the discussions
- **Chris** to present on how OAuth or OpenID can interact with DID-based solutions in the next meeting
- **Gaowei** to continue research on W3C verifiable credentials and authorization technologies
- **Michael** to follow up on the chain of trust issue he raised on the community GitHub
- **Song** to share information about the IETF meeting and potential reuse of agent solutions in 6G design after the next meeting
- **All participants** to continue discussions on the Slack channel

## Detailed Summary

### Zoom Multilingual Translation Demo

The meeting focused on testing Zoom's real-time translation capabilities for multilingual communication. Song and Gaowei demonstrated the functionality by speaking in English while displaying Chinese captions, which worked smoothly. Bedirhan and Dervish from Turkey joined the meeting and tested speaking in Turkish, with English translations visible to all participants. The group discussed how the system could improve communication for non-English speakers, though some translation inaccuracies were noted. The meeting chairs encouraged attendees to test the multilingual feature and requested that participants speak in their native language if they wished, with English repetition required if needed for clarity.

### TPAC 2025 CG Meeting Overview

Song introduced the agenda for the upcoming CG meeting and breakout session at TPAC 2025 in November. He explained the logistics for both the CG meeting and the informal breakout session, which will be held on-site and potentially online. Roy clarified that all TPAC participants can attend these meetings, and online tools will be provided for those who cannot attend in person. Bedirhan gave a brief presentation about his project, which aims to improve web navigation and indexing, and discussed his team's interest in working with the CG's current specifications.

### Aura: Sustainable Web Interaction Protocol

Bedirhan presented a new protocol called **Aura**, which aims to make web interactions more efficient and sustainable for AI agents. Key features include:

- Uses a JSON file to define website capabilities
- Allows agents to quickly understand and interact with websites without costly scraping methods
- Inspired by Dervis's implementation and AMP
- Plans to improve agent identification and authentication methods in the future

The goal of Aura is to create a more sustainable web for site owners, with benefits including:
- Better control over agent interactions
- Improved performance
- Simplified integrations

### DID Authentication Standardization Project

Bedirhan presented on a project that aims to standardize and align with W3C standards, focusing on authentication and identity management using **DID (Decentralized Identifiers)**. Key points discussed:

- Research into different identity solutions led to choosing DID for its comprehensive capabilities
- DID supports both organizational and per-user identities
- Chris inquired about alternative methods like robots.txt and identity federation
- The team explored various options but found DID to be the most suitable solution
- Discussion on AI translation quality: generally accurate for non-Turkish languages but less so for Turkish due to language diversity and speaker context

### W3C Agent Protocol Community Contribution

Bedirhan and his team expressed interest in contributing to the W3C's agent protocol community group. The discussion covered:

- **Current status**: The group is in early development stages with a completed initial white paper and ongoing technical specification work
- **Contribution opportunities**:
  - Reviewing development status
  - Presenting demos
  - Engaging with specification writers
  - Adding their project to the white paper on GitHub
  - Participating in the mailing list

### AI Identity Interoperability Discussion

Gaowei led a discussion on the importance of identity authorization for AI agents, emphasizing:

- **Interoperability** as a key requirement
- **DID** as a suitable identity solution
- The protocol should not be tied to a specific identity solution
- Need to explore other identity schemes for compatibility

**Key contributions from participants**:
- **Chris and Victor**: Highlighted the need for solutions that integrate with existing systems like OAuth and OpenID
- **Gaowei**: Expressed interest in examining OpenID solutions in the next meeting
- **Michael**: Shared insights from IETF meetings on agent protocols and authentication challenges
- **Song**: Mentioned interest in reusing agent solutions for 6G technology

The group agreed to continue discussions in the next meeting.
