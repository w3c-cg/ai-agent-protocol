## Quick recap


The meeting introduced the newly formed AI Agent Protocol Community, which aims to define and develop agent communication protocols using W3C technologies. The Community Group will explore and define: inter-agent communication protocols for discovery and collaboration, agent identity models based on open standards, standardized metadata formats for agent capabilities, security and privacy mechanisms , and protocol interoperability with existing Web standards. The group discussed their evolution from semantic web to agent web, emphasizing the need for standardized protocols to accommodate agent autonomy and collaboration with humans. The conversation ended with discussions about ongoing collaborations, white paper development, and the establishment of communication channels for future work, with the next meeting scheduled in two weeks.

## Summary


### AI Agent Protocol Community Launch


Song introduced the first meeting of the newly created AI Agent Protocol Community Group (CG), explaining its formation six weeks after the previous meeting in Sofia. Song outlined the meeting agenda, which included introductions, aims and deliverables of the CG, a draft white paper, and future work plans. Song and other attendees, including Samuel Schlenzinger, Ken Huang, and Roy, provided brief introductions of their backgrounds and interests related to the CG's focus areas. Song requested consent for recording the meeting using AI tools and mentioned that meeting minutes would be distributed via email.

### CG Aims and Deliverables Overview


Song introduced the aims and deliverables of the CG, focusing on defining interagent communication protocols, agent identity models, metadata formats, security and privacy mechanisms, and protocol interoperability. He explained that the CG will research and develop specifications that are enterprise-grade and Internet-oriented, using W3C technologies like DID, VC, XML, RDF, and others. Song also discussed the arrangements of the CG, including its GitHub repository, bi-weekly meetings, and collaboration with the WebAgents CG. He invited questions and suggestions from the group, and mentioned a white paper that has been published on GitHub for further discussion.

### AI Agents in Agent Web


Song discussed the evolution from semantic web to agent web, highlighting the increasing role of AI agents in internet activities. He emphasized the need to redesign protocols and scenarios to accommodate the autonomy of AI agents, which will serve as important collaborators for humans in the future. Song also mentioned the impact of AI agents on the software industry and their requirement for universal interconnection. The white paper aims to provide background information and trends to facilitate further work on technology specifications.

### Agent Protocol Standardization White Paper


Song presented a white paper on agent protocols, focusing on the need for standardized protocols for agent collaboration and interaction. He highlighted key challenges in the industry, including the lack of standard protocols and human-machine interfaces for agents. Song emphasized the importance of defining the core functions and requirements for an agent protocol, with a focus on creating an agent identity for the Internet domain. The team plans to continue working on the white paper, aiming to provide concrete deliverables like the agent web protocol specification in the coming months.

### CG Collaboration and Communication Planning


The meeting focused on the newly created CG within W3C, with Ken highlighting their published paper on Agent Naming Service and ongoing collaboration with Linux Foundation and MIT. Song emphasized the need for focused work aligned with existing goals and deliverables, while Victor raised questions about open source collaboration plans. Dominique suggested that communication with other projects is key at this stage, and Victor proposed creating a Slack workspace for better communication. The group agreed to continue discussions in the next meeting in two weeks.
