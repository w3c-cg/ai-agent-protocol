# Meeting Summary for AI Agent Protocol CG Meeting (09/24/2025)

## Meeting Summary

### Quick Summary

Sunner introduced his MarkdownFlow open-source project to the attendees, a unified interaction standard based on Markdown format, demonstrating its functionality and future plans. The meeting also discussed agent description protocols and markdown flow-related issues. Due to time constraints, the originally planned ANP open-source project demo and MCP vs TMEP topic discussions were postponed to the next meeting.

### Next Steps

- **seanzhang**: Ensure AI Companion functionality remains enabled during meetings.
- **Sunner**: Continue introducing and sharing detailed information about the Markdown Flow open-source project.
- **Sunner**: Integrate with protocols like MCP and ANP to enable Markdown Flow to connect with the external world.
- **Sunner**: Define canvas specifications to generate HTML content within defined boundaries.

## Detailed Summary

### DID Standardization and Technical Setup Discussion

The meeting began with Roy and GaoWei discussing the progress of DID (Digital Identity) standardization. The meeting then shifted to technical setup, including enabling AI meeting recording functionality and transferring host privileges. Finally, Song introduced the agenda for the day's meeting, including the introduction of the MarkdownFlow open-source project and discussion of the current status of protocol standardization processes.

### MarkdownFlow Open-Source Project Introduction

Sunner introduced his recently developed open-source project MarkdownFlow to the attendees, a standard aimed at providing a unified interaction format for artificial intelligence agents and human users. The project is based on markdown format and designed with several extended syntaxes, including variable definitions, radio buttons, checkboxes, and open input fields, aimed at supporting the creation of personalized, interactive, and multimodal content.

Sunner demonstrated the project's demo, showing how to use MarkdownFlow to create personalized resume introductions and AI teaching content, and discussed future plans, including integration with ANP protocol and support for real-time audio streaming. Song expressed appreciation for the project and raised questions about whether MarkdownFlow might become a bottleneck for agent protocol interaction with human users. Sunner explained that the current system has low hardware and software requirements but still needs high-performance large language models to run.

### Markdown Flow Discussion

GaoWei participated from a high-speed train in discussions about agent description protocols and markdown flow-related issues. Sunner explained that markdown flow does not require strict syntax validation because it is understood by large language models and was designed with good fault tolerance and user-friendliness. The discussion mentioned that while markdown flow may have errors, they can be corrected through manual testing and adjustment, and since it doesn't connect to external tools, there are currently no security concerns.

### MarkdownFlow Project Follow-up Discussion

The meeting discussed the introduction of the MarkdownFlow project and its intersection with current work. Due to technical issues and time constraints, the originally planned introduction by Shanghai of the ANP open-source project discovery component and protocol design work could not be completed due to connection problems. Chris indicated he was prepared to demonstrate the MCP vs TMEP topic, but due to insufficient time, decided to postpone the demonstration to the next meeting and will conduct the same demonstration at the OpenID AI group meeting.
