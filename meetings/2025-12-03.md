- **Song**: Find contact information from Teemu's GitHub links for further communication
- **Victor**: Summarize discussion about shared responsibility for agent provider and agent user in email or WC Slack
- **Song**: Encourage Shane and ANP community experts to speak with teams regarding potential collaboration opportunities

## Summary

### Autonomous Agents Feedback Analysis

Song discussed feedback from recent workshops and meetings about autonomous agents and web protocols. Key topics included:

- Accountability and SEO considerations for autonomous agents
- Challenges in agent adoption
- Progress in agent payment systems

Song also addressed questions about agent purchasing power and the sufficiency of existing protocols for AI communication. The conversation ended with plans to analyze questions and answers from a recent W3C meeting and to continue discussions with the community team.

### Agent Payment Protocol Integration Overview

Song introduced a presentation on agent payment protocols, focusing on **ANP (Agent Network Protocol)** and its integration with **AP2** and **X402** payment standards. 

Key points:

- **AP2** enables shopping agents to facilitate user-merchant transactions through a structured payment mandate system
- **X402** supports simpler machine-to-machine payments through DID-based authentication
- Song discussed the future evolution of payment systems, predicting:
  - A shift from super apps to personal assistants
  - A move from platform-centric to protocol-centric connectivity

### Identity and Trust in Payment Protocols

The meeting focused on discussing identity and trust mechanisms in payment protocols, particularly comparing AP2 and AMP approaches:

- **Seanzhang** explained that AP2 lacks a clear identity layer, while AMP uses WebDIDs to enable both agents and users to have standardized identities that can be validated through public key verification
- **George** raised questions about the practicality of DIDs for existing user identities managed by services like Gmail, suggesting alternative approaches like verifiable credentials and holder binding
- **Teemu** shared his previous work on agent-commerce integration
- **Victor** suggested that key points from the discussion should be documented in the WC Slack or email
