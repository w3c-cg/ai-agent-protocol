# Meeting summary for AI Agent Protocol CG meeting (08/13/2025)

## Quick recap

The meeting covered upcoming events and updates related to the CGs portal and autonomous agents, including discussions about web authentication and meetings in Japan. The team reviewed progress on various documents and protocols, including agent interaction scenarios, use cases, and authentication processes. The group explored implementation details around decentralized identifiers, encryption methods, and trust mechanisms across different platforms, with plans to continue discussions on GitHub and reconvene in two weeks.

- Team: Consider adding background/principles section to the use case document
- Team: Consider expanding use cases to cover telecommunications and other industries
- Team: Consider adding privacy/encryption considerations to the protocol document

## Summary

### CG Portal and Agents Updates

The meeting discussed upcoming events and updates related to the CGs portal and autonomous agents. Song shared the agenda for a CG meeting in Kobe, Japan, in November, and mentioned another relevant meeting on web authentication. Chris suggested that web authentication could be relevant to autonomous agents' ability to authenticate themselves. Song encouraged CG members to attend these meetings. The group also discussed updates to the CGs portal, including the agent network protocol white paper and use cases document. Gaowei was invited to provide an update on the progress of these documents, which would be published on the CGs portal later in the week.

### Unified Agent Protocol Scenarios

Gw introduced a document outlining scenarios and requirements for agent interactions across platforms, focusing on a unified agent protocol. The document covers three key concepts: service agents acting on behalf of users, specialist service agents providing support to other agents, and search agents helping connect different agents. Two use cases were presented: a hotel booking scenario where a personal agent assists with finding and booking accommodations, and a meeting scheduler scenario where agents automatically coordinate meeting times between parties.

### AI Protocol Use Case Expansion

Song suggested extending the AI agent protocol use cases to cover telecommunications, broadcasting, and media industries, while Chris emphasized the need for a higher-level abstraction and context in the use cases to capture common patterns and principles, such as authorization and access management. Both agreed that the current use cases serve as exemplars of base operations but could benefit from additional context and abstraction to enrich the document.

### Agent Authentication and Protocol Standards

The group discussed agent behavior and authentication protocols, with Chris highlighting the need for consistency in implementing principles like least privilege. Sean shared use cases focusing on transaction accountability and private data handling, while Chris noted the challenge of applying modern concepts to legacy systems. The discussion concluded with Gaowei presenting a protocol documentation built on W3C DID standards for agent identity and cross-platform association, which Song requested a review of.

### DID Implementation and Trust Systems

The discussion focused on DID (Decentralized Identifiers) and their implementation across different platforms. The conversation detailed how DIDs are created and controlled by their subjects, emphasizing their role in establishing trust across various ecosystems. A specific method called "DID:WebAuthn" was discussed, which combines the strengths of DIDs with web infrastructure to enable easier identity and use management at scale. The method involves using HTTP protocols for verification and authentication, where clients can use access tokens instead of repeated signatures for subsequent requests, making interactions more efficient and secure.

### Authentication System Privacy Requirements

The team discussed authentication system requirements and privacy considerations for a future case. Chris, with experience as a Federation operator, highlighted that SAML 2.0 allows for end-to-end privacy or encryption, questioning whether similar measures would be implemented in their system. He raised concerns about the security of JWT tokens and the lack of cryptographic protection for observation, suggesting that if a malicious actor could intercept the tokens, they would need to defeat only the HTTPS tunnel to access the data. Gawie confirmed that the system uses HTTPS on their server to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.

### Encryption and Trust in PaaS

The discussion focused on encryption and trust in platform-as-a-service scenarios, with Chris providing an example of Microsoft hosting services where HTTP connections are encrypted but the provider can decrypt all customer traffic. The group discussed how identity authentication and end-to-end encryption could be implemented, with gw suggesting using two separate protocols. Chris raised concerns about trust establishment and privacy of actors in these scenarios, noting that these aspects may need further discussion in the document.

### Authentication and Authorization Discussion

The group discussed authentication and authorization processes, with Michael raising questions about the trust mechanism between agents and the role of VC (Verifiable Credentials) in resource access. Song suggested continuing the detailed discussion on GitHub for better accessibility and documentation, and the conversation ended with an agreement to continue the conversation there. Song also mentioned that meeting minutes would be sent and the next meeting would be held in two weeks.
