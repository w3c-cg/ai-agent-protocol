# Meeting Assets for AI Agent Protocol CG Meeting

**Date**: 2025-12-17

## Quick Recap

The team held their final meeting of the year to discuss agent authentication schemes, with Sean presenting a proposal focused on cross-platform identity mechanisms. The discussion centered on separating authentication from authorization, using cryptographic identities, and supporting both automatic and human-authenticated signatures. George provided feedback suggesting that while the requirements-based approach was valuable, the team should consider alternative implementations beyond WebDID and address privacy concerns related to ephemeral identifiers. The team agreed to leave the PR open for additional review through early January and to add more diagrams and flow charts to help clarify the design principles.

## Next Steps

- **Sean**: Provide additional diagrams and flow diagrams to help the team understand the agent identity mechanism more deeply
- **Sean**: Add more diagrams and tables to the document to make it more readable and consistent with other sections, before final agreement on design principles
- **All team members**: Review the PR in GitHub and provide comments or challenges to the design principles by the beginning of January

## Summary

### Agent Authentication and Next Meeting

The meeting focused on discussing the agent authentication scheme and planning for the next meeting. Song announced that the next meeting would be held on January 14th, 2024. Galway was expected to present a PowerPoint presentation, but there was some confusion about the order of topics to be covered. The meeting was scheduled to be the last one for the year, with a brief discussion on GitHub pull requests.

### Agent Identity Framework Discussion

Sean presented a framework for agent identity mechanism, focusing on six key principles. The framework proposes using cryptographic identities for authentication, separating authentication from authorization, supporting cross-platform interactions, reducing active authentication, enabling dual-way authentication, and allowing agents and users to have independent identities for privacy protection. George appreciated the requirement-based approach but suggested considering other identifier systems beyond DIDs, such as client attestation and client ID metadata.

### Agent Trust and Identifier Dynamics

George discussed the importance of instance identifiers versus class identifiers in agent trust dynamics and raised concerns about the tension between ephemeral identifiers and compliance requirements, particularly in financial services. Sean agreed that Web DIDs are a suitable solution but suggested that users should have the option to maintain stable identifiers for specific transactions, such as repeat purchases or flights, while still allowing for privacy. Roy inquired about cryptographic standards for public-private key identification and whether mutual authentication could prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, to which Sean confirmed that mutual authentication is crucial for preventing such attacks and ensuring secure agent transactions.

### GitHub Pull Request Review Discussion

The team discussed a pull request in GitHub, with Song suggesting to leave it open for a few more days before making a final decision. Sean proposed adding additional diagrams and flow charts to help the team better understand the design principles. Song agreed this would be helpful, but emphasized the need for more diagrams and tables to make the document more readable and consistent. The conversation ended with Roy wishing everyone a happy holiday, and the team expressing gratitude for each other's contributions.
