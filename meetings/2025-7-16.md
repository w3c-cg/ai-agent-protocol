### AI Protocols and Collaboration Tools

The meeting began with a discussion about collaboration tools, where Song and Roy agreed that Google Docs could be used for community group work, unlike working groups and interest groups which use GitHub. Wenjing then presented an introduction to AI agent protocols and the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP), though the presentation was cut short due to time constraints. The meeting agenda included four items: introducing a new plantation sharing, updating the technical CD report, and discussing use cases, with the possibility of designing future topics after Wenjing's presentation.

### TSP Presentation and Discussion

#### AI Agent Trust Protocol Enhancement

Wenjing discussed the need for an agent protocol to manage complexity and facilitate easier training of AI agents. She highlighted the importance of distinguishing between security and trust, explaining that while security focuses on authentication and authorization, trust involves value alignment and control. Wenjing suggested enhancing existing protocols like MCP and A2A by adding a trust scheme on top of the transport layer, rather than designing a new protocol. She emphasized that current best practices for security are insufficient and proposed strengthening these measures with additional schemes like X.509 certificates and two-factor authentication.

#### Trust Spanning Protocol Overview

Wenjing presented examples of Mcp and TA2 protocols, highlighting how they introduce verifiable names and wallets for secure storage of agent identities and credentials. She explained that the Trust Spanning Protocol (TSP) manages trust relationships through verifiable identifiers, which can include various types of existing identifiers beyond just DIDs, and emphasized that verification is always the first action of the TSP.

#### TSP Design Principles Overview

Wenjing explained the design principles of TSP, a messaging protocol that is agnostic to networking layers and aims for minimalism and efficiency. She discussed the concept of autonomy, where endpoints like wallets can be clients, servers, or agents, and emphasized the importance of long-term identities for verification and reputation building. Wenjing also covered privacy aspects, distinguishing between content privacy through encryption and metadata privacy to protect against network tracking.

#### TSP: A Communication Protocol Framework

Wenjing presented a protocol called TSP that serves as a foundational layer for building various communication schemes, including verifiable credentials and delegation protocols. She explained that TSP supports multiple encoding formats like JSON and CBOR through its Caesar protocol, which enables composable and reversible encoding. Wenjing also described how intermediaries in the system help maintain privacy by limiting visibility of message content and path information, similar to how internet routers function.

#### TSP Development and Security Applications

Wenjing presented on the development of TSP (Trust over Secure Protocol) and its applications in enhancing security and trust properties, particularly in AI agent interactions. She explained ongoing work on creating credentials and content authenticity, including a joint effort with C2PA and another working group. Wenjing demonstrated an open-source implementation of TSP and discussed upcoming workshops in Hangzhou and potentially San Francisco. Song and Chris provided positive feedback and questions about the presentation.

#### Trust Routing and Intermediary Systems

Chris and Wenjing discussed trust routing and intermediaries, comparing it to the AvFab scheme from the IETF. Wenjing explained their approach, which allows endpoints to rely on intermediaries as a service while maintaining privacy and efficiency. Chris noted that similar technology is already implemented in some SSH libraries and Linux systems. They also touched on the need for trustworthy intermediaries and the lack of multilateralism in trust evaluation.

#### Long-Term Identifiers for Identity Verification

Wenjing discussed the concept of long-term identifiers and their importance in maintaining a verifiable history through key events like creation and rotation. She explained that credentials, such as driver's licenses or endorsements, can be tied to these identifiers to establish a stronger identity over time, while maintaining anonymity if desired. Wenjing emphasized that this infrastructure provides a foundation for applications to build upon, allowing for both automated and non-automated verification methods, such as facial recognition, to further establish the identity of an entity.

#### Interoperability in Edge Computing

Victor and Chris discussed the need for interoperability between OpenID and DID-based protocols, particularly in edge computing environments. They agreed that drafting IETF RFCs could help bridge the gap between these two worlds. Wenjing suggested that TSP could be used to enhance existing systems like DNS, and proposed a flexible approach where MCP could be run on top of TSP for critical moments, while maintaining compatibility with existing infrastructure.

#### Certificate Checking System Integration Discussion

The group discussed the implementation and adoption of a mutual certificate checking system and its integration with TSP (Trust Service Protocol), which can operate over various transport layers including TCP, UDP, and even wireless protocols. Wenjing explained that TSP doesn't require TLS and can run over untrusted networks, while Ken suggested creating an IETF documentation to improve adoption and build trust. The discussion concluded with Ken proposing collaborative efforts with MIT's Project Nanda and the development of a chest layer for the agent economy, with Wenjing sharing plans to explore IoT implementations and gateway designs for high-throughput messaging systems.

#### Trust Service Protocol Discussion

The meeting focused on discussing the Trust Service Protocol (TSP) and its role in establishing trust within a network. Wenjing explained that TSP acts as a bootstrap protocol for verifying identifiers and building reputation systems, which can be enhanced through long-term identifiers and credentials issued by third parties. Ken suggested incorporating a reputation scoring mechanism to measure trust levels, while Wenjing emphasized that TSP provides the framework for such systems to be built upon. The group agreed to continue the discussion on use cases and protocol status in the next meeting, and Song mentioned plans to post meeting content and slides for further review.

### Use Cases Discussion

Due to time constraints, use cases will be discussed in the next meeting. Here is the link to the use cases: https://github.com/w3c-cg/ai-agent-protocol/issues/15
