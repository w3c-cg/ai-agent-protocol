# AI Agent Protocol CG Meeting Minutes

**Date**: 2025-10-22

---

## Meeting Summary

### Quick Summary

The meeting primarily discussed various approaches for agent discovery mechanisms, including the MCP registry center, ANP's DNS-based discovery mechanism, and the Well-known mechanism based on RFC 8615 standard. The team leaned towards selecting the RFC 8615 approach as the primary solution, with other approaches as alternatives, and planned to conduct more in-depth discussions at the TPAC meeting. The meeting also briefly discussed preparations for the upcoming W3C TPAC Global technical conference in Kobe, Japan, including meeting room arrangements, participant numbers, and main agenda items.

### Next Steps

- **Song**: Edit the TPAC meeting agenda on GitHub, including discussion topics: CG charter introduction, showcase of existing contributions, GitHub issue discussions, and Q&A session.
- **Song**: Add content about different AI-related working groups within W3C and their relationships to the TPAC meeting presentation.
- **Gaowei**: Supplement the agent discovery mechanism document with descriptions of how search engines find agent identifiers based on user intent.
- **Song**: Keep the agent discovery mechanism approach open and make decisions after more in-depth discussions at the TPAC meeting.
- **Roy**: Provide online access services for the TPAC meeting to facilitate remote participants joining.

## Detailed Meeting Content

### 1. Agent Discovery and TPAC Preparation

Song chaired the meeting and introduced two main topics: agent discovery solutions and TPAC meeting preparation. Song mentioned that while regular meetings have fewer participants, the TPAC meeting in Kobe, Japan already has 260 registered attendees, far exceeding the typical 10 times the number of regular online meetings. Gaowei began discussing the agent discovery mechanism, presenting in Chinese, and planned to share his screen to display relevant content.

### 2. Agent Discovery Mechanism Discussion

Gaowei introduced several agent discovery mechanisms:

- **MCP Registry Center Mechanism**: Requires community review
- **ANP DNS-based Discovery Mechanism**: Uses a discovery mechanism similar to Agent World (AW)
- **Well-known Mechanism based on RFC 8615 Standard**: Web standard approach

These mechanisms all support agent registration and discovery. ANP and AW use similar discovery mechanisms, with the only difference being that AW uses agent code. Gaowei also mentioned other discovery approaches discussed on the mailing list, including message attachment-based discovery and discovery mechanisms based on registry centers and ANP.

### 3. Agent Discovery Mechanism Approach Discussion

Gaowei discussed three approaches for agent discovery mechanisms:

1. **RFC 8615-based DNS Discovery**
2. **Global Registry Center Approach**
3. **Blockchain-based Decentralized Approach**

The team leaned towards selecting the RFC 8615 approach as the primary solution, with other approaches as alternatives. Song suggested keeping the choice of discovery mechanism open in the protocol draft and planned to conduct more in-depth discussions during Phase 2 of TPAC.

### 4. Agent Identifier Recognition Approach Discussion

Michael raised the importance of the identifier recognition step in the agent discovery process, pointing out that the current discussion focuses on how to store agent descriptions rather than how to find agent identifiers based on intent.

Michael suggested retaining all three existing approaches for users to choose from, suitable for different industries and organizational scenarios. Song indicated that while maintaining all approaches might add complexity that could affect internet protocols, he was willing to further discuss this issue on GitHub. Gaowei suggested providing a basic approach while maintaining extensibility, supporting mechanisms based on 8615 and registry centers.

### 5. Two-Step Process of Agent Discovery

Michael inquired about the two-step process of the agent discovery mechanism:

1. First, find the agent through ID or URL
2. Then find the actual IP address through DNS or other means

Gaowei explained that there are currently two lookup approaches:

- Finding agent URLs through search engines
- DID-based lookup

Michael suggested describing the implementation of the first step more explicitly in the discover protocol, as this part currently has ambiguity. Song expressed concerns about discovering agents through commercial search engines, believing this doesn't adequately meet the requirements for direct communication between agents.

### 6. W3C TPAC Global Technical Conference Preparation

Song chaired a brief meeting discussing preparations for the upcoming W3C TPAC Global technical conference in Kobe, Japan:

- **Location**: R03 meeting room
- **Expected Participants**: 60 people
- **Duration**: 2 hours 15 minutes

**Main topics discussed include**:

- Reviewing the original design of the CG
- Showcasing documents contributed by global developers (including YSE white paper and use case documents)
- Reviewing GitHub issues
- Q&A about relationships between different W3C groups

Victor suggested providing a relationship diagram or overview of different W3C groups to help global developers understand the roles of each group.
