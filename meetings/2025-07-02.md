# Meeting summary for AI Agent Protocol CG meeting (07/02/2025)

## Quick recap


The AI Agent Protocol CG held its second meeting to review and discuss their white paper and technical report focusing on decentralized identity and agentic network protocols. Gao Wei provided a comprehensive overview of the protocol technical documentation structure, covering key modules including agent identity, description, discovery, security, and privacy considerations. The group explored various technical aspects including DID and JSON-LD technologies for interoperability, while discussing the differences between their work and existing standardized projects. The group agreeing to continue discussions through their GitHub repository and Slack channel.

## Next steps

- All attendees to review and provide feedback on the existing white paper via GitHub.
- Victor to contribute additional description on centralized identity to the white paper via GitHub.
- Chris to add comments on workload identity and delegated identities to the white paper via GitHub.
- Song to raise a PR on GitHub to add information about network capabilities from the telecom industry perspective to the white paper.
- All attendees to continue the discussion on agent discovery mechanisms in GitHub Issue #13.
- All attendees to join the AI Agent Protocol Slack channel for ongoing communication.
- Roy to migrate relevant information from Zoom chat to the Slack channel for archiving.

## Summary


AI Agent Protocol Review Meeting


The AI Agent Protocol CG held its second meeting, where Song and Gao Wei co-chaired the discussion. The group reviewed the white paper, which describes the agentic network protocol focusing on decentralized identity, and discussed the technical CG report that outlines key protocol components including agent identity, description, and discovery mechanisms. Gao Wei provided a detailed presentation of the protocol technical documentation structure (https://w3c-cg.github.io/ai-agent-protocol/protocol.html), explaining the overall architecture and key modules including agent identity, agent description, agent discovery, security considerations, and privacy considerations. He presented examples using DID and JSON-LD technologies for interoperability and information sharing between agents, while the group agreed to continue discussions on the white paper and technical report through their GitHub repository and Slack channel.

## Agentic Protocols Identity Discussion


The group discussed the white paper and its focus on describing general information, use cases, and scenarios for agentic protocols. Song explained that while there is an existing standardized project on decentralized IDs (DID), the scope of their work is slightly different and will include features relevant to agent networks like discovery mechanisms and security. Michael raised concerns about the lack of a preferred ID solution, but Song assured the group that all options are open for discussion. Victor introduced three key topics: identity (both decentralized and centralized), authorization, and trust, emphasizing the need for collaboration between centralized and decentralized identity systems. Chris highlighted the importance of clarifying the context of identity when discussing workload agents, suggesting that it's an area worth acknowledging rather than solving.

## White Paper Network Updates Discussion


The group discussed updates to a white paper, with Song proposing to add network capabilities and agent communication network features based on recent research from the telecom industry. They addressed GitHub issue #13 regarding naming services, with Song presenting two options: traditional DNS (RFC 8615) and alternative approaches like FOAF agent. The conversation ended with Roy suggesting a migration from Zoom chat to Slack for better documentation of discussions, and Chris inquiring about the timeline for publishing the white paper, which Roy clarified would remain a living document to accommodate evolving technology.
