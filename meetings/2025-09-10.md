# Meeting Summary for AI Agent Protocol CG Meeting (09/10/2025)

## Meeting Summary

The meeting focused on comparing three intelligent agent interaction models and discussing their respective advantages, particularly highlighting ANP's compatibility with existing protocols and better privacy protection compared to other models. The group explored data exchange protocols and trust evaluation techniques, with discussions centered around JSON-LD's advantages and the need for unified trust models across different technologies. The conversation ended with reflections on a recent AI agent workshop that covered high-performance applications and open web ecosystem topics, with plans for further discussions on Trust over IP and security specifications in future sessions.

## Next Steps

- **Chris** to prepare a presentation on trust models, including a landscape of different trust models and their relevance to AI agent interactions
- **Song** to follow up with Chris about planning the next meeting's presentation on OIDC and security
- **GaoWei and Chris** to continue their discussion about trust and security aspects via email

## Detailed Summary

### Intelligent Agent Interaction Models Comparison

GaoWei presented a comparison of three interaction models for intelligent agents: MC, AT, and ANP. He explained that MC is a client-server architecture suitable for remote calling, AT is a task-delegation model that breaks down large tasks into smaller ones, and ANP is a data-crawling method that connects agent data via URLs. GaoWei  highlighted ANP's advantages, including compatibility with existing protocols, caching ability, search friendliness, and better privacy protection compared to AT's task-delegation approach.

### JSON-LD for Semantic Data Exchange

The meeting focused on discussing the use of different protocols and formats for data exchange, particularly JSON-LD and its advantages over traditional methods. Victor and Chris highlighted the differences between MCP and other projects like SPDX, emphasizing the use of JSON-LD for semantic web and its ability to enable more complex and flexible use cases. Chris raised concerns about the absence of trust markers in current protocols, suggesting that a critical assessment of missing elements is necessary when considering interoperability models. The discussion also touched on the importance of considering machine complexity and the potential for scaling up information traversal tasks.

### Trust Evaluation and Protocol Gaps

The group discussed trust evaluation techniques and gaps in current protocols like MCP and ANP. Chris emphasized the need for a unified view of trust across different technologies, while Victor highlighted the challenges of trust in agentic web environments. GaoWei  explained that MCP and ANP serve different purposes, with MCP focusing on connecting models to tools and resources, and ANP on enterprise internal agent collaboration. The discussion touched on the potential for improved practices and community guidelines in handling agent interactions on the internet.

### Trust Over IP Security Discussion

The group discussed security concerns and the scope of Trust over IP, with Victor suggesting it belongs to the same ecosystem as ANP and may include Knowledge graph and Jason or D. Chris agreed to prepare thoughts on Trust over IP for the next presentation to clarify any misunderstandings. Song emphasized the need to define scenarios for different contexts when designing solutions based on WCC technology, and proposed inviting Chris to give a presentation on OpenID Connect security in the next meeting. The group agreed to continue the discussion on Trust over IP and review the specification in the next session.

### AI Agent Workshop Insights

The meeting focused on a recent AI agent workshop that covered two main topics: high-performance cross-web applications and AI agents in the open web ecosystem, featuring over 10 speakers. Song discussed the workshop's content, including AI agent use cases in telecom infrastructure and the potential for reusing security and identity specifications from the Internet. Chris and Victor explored trust models in different contexts, with Chris highlighting the separation between customer identity and enterprise ecosystem management, and Victor suggesting the creation of a trust model landscape. The conversation ended with plans for further discussion in the next call.
